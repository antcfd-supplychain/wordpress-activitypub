# Contributing to ActivityPub for WordPress

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Developers of all levels can help — whether you can barely recognize a filter (or don’t know what that means) or you’ve already authored your own plugins, there are ways for you to pitch in.

## Create Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please use our [bug report form](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/issues/new?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&template=bug_report.yml). This helps us gather the information we need efficiently.

**Keep your bug reports focused and actionable:**
- Include specific steps to reproduce the issue.
- Provide the URL of the page that has the bug.
- Describe what you expected to see and what happened instead.
- Stay within the plugin's scope—issues unrelated to ActivityPub functionality may be closed.

If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

## Write and submit a patch

If you'd like to fix a bug or make an enhancement, you can submit a Pull Request. Before you get started, you'll want to **[set up your development environment.](docs/development-environment.md)**

Once your development environment is ready, you can get started and [create your first Pull Request!](docs/pull-request.md)

### Get started

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to get started, you can take a look at existing issues:

- ["Good First Issues"](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/labels/%5BType%5D%20Good%20First%20Issue) are a good entry point to get familiar with ActivityPub plugin's code base.
- All issues labeled with [the "Good For Community" label](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+For+Community%22) are fair game. That's a great way to contribute new features and fix small issues within the ActivityPub plugin.
